__My Ludum Dare #31 Game__

#Phantom Tower: Classics

This is a fun Retro game for memorizing great games in our childhood. 
I created five levels, each for one classic game, you must know them, let's use the classic tricks to break down the phantom tower. 

To play it, you can use all desktop browsers, I personally tested Chrome, Safari, but with cocos2d-js, it should work also on Firefox, IE 10+, etc. I will port it to mobile browsers and mobile native platforms later.
